1. Introduction 
A megacity is defined by the United Nations as a metropolitan area with a total population 
of more than 10 million people. This chapter provides a brief introduction to the air 
pollution in megacities worldwide. This is an extensive topic and brings together recent 
comprehensive reviews from particular megacities. We have here highlighted the air quality 
in megacities that are of particular relevance to health effects.  
The main objective of this chapter is to enhance our understanding of the polluted 
atmosphere in megacities, with respect to the emission characteristics, climate, population 
and specific meteorological conditions that are leading to episodes. Therefore, the chapter 
will provide state-of-the-art reviews of air pollution sources and air quality in some selected 
megacities, particularly Beijing, Cairo, Delhi and Istanbul. Furthermore, a detailed analysis 
of emission sources, air quality, mesoscale atmospheric systems and local meteorology 
leading to air pollution episodes in Istanbul will be extensively presented.  
The world population is expected to rise by 2.3 billion, passing from 6.8 billion to 9.1 billion 
in between 2009 and 2050 (UN Report, 2010). Additionally, population living in urban areas 
is projected to gain 2.9 billion from 3.4 to 6.3 billion in this period. However, during the 
industrial revolution years, only about 10% of the total population lived in the cities. As an 
example, in 1820, which is the beginning times of the United States (US) transformation 
from rural to urban, the great majority of the population lived in rural areas of US (about 
96%) (Kim, 2007). Today, according to UN Report the world population in urban areas has 
reached to 50.5%. In other words, half of the world's population are concentrated in the 
cities. However, distribution of urban population in the world is not evenly. A significant 
diversity in the urbanization levels can be seen in different regions of the world. About 75% 
of the inhabitants of the more developed regions lived in urban areas in 2010, whereas this 
ratio was 45% in the less developed regions. It is expected that urbanization will continue to 
rise in both more developed and less developed regions by 2050 with about 86% and 69%, 
respectively. These developments have created new physical, social and economic processes 
in the cities. For example, uncontrolled urban sprawl has leaded the rising of environmental

problems due to high traffic volume, irregular industry, and low quality housing, etc. 
Massive urbanization in the cities due to the better job opportunities and challenges in the 
urban areas began first in Europe and then in other regions of the world, particularly in Asia. 
At this point, urbanization levels have led to a new classification and a concept- megacity- 
which is usually defined as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of 10 million 
inhabitants. Megacities are highly diverse in the world, spanning from Paris (France), Los 
Angeles, New York City (USA) in developed countries to Delhi (India), Dhaka (Bengladesh) 
and Lagos (Nigeria) in developing countries. In today’s developing countries, megacities 
exhibit the highest levels of pollution and therefore, in the studies of the anthropogenic impact 
on atmospheric composition, have become of primary importance, particularly those having 
high traffic volumes, industrial activities and domestic heating emissions.  
The United Nations Environment Programme Urban Environment (UNEP-UE) unit 
expressed that more than 1 billion people are exposed to outdoor air pollution annually and 
the urban air pollution is linked to up to 1 million premature deaths and 1 million pre-native 
deaths each year. Additionally, UNEP presented the cost of urban air pollution with 
approximately 2% of GDP in developed countries and 5% in developing countries, 
respectively. In addition, the UNEP/Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) 
reported that rapid industrialization, burgeoning cities, and greater dependency on fossil 
fuels have caused increasing production of harmful pollutants, creating significant health 
problems in most urban cities. The serious air quality problems, specifically inverse health 
effects, have been experienced in megacities of both developing and developed countries. 
due to the exposure to high concentrations of particular matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) depending 
on country’s technology level. Especially, exposure to eleveted levels of particular matter 
and surface ozone causes loss of life-expectancy, acute and chronic respiratory and 
cardiovascular effects. Furthermore, damage to the ecosystem biodiversity by excess 
nitrogen nutrient is an important consequence of pollution.  
In the beginning of the 2011, The European Commusion released a paper about the current 
policy efforts and the expected results to maintain a hard line against countries that are yet 
to comply with EU air quality legistlation limiting fine particulate matter (PM2.5) 
concentrations. WHO (2009) concluded that megacities have faced particularly health 
impact by transportation, governance, water and sanitation, safety, food security, water and 
sanitation, emergency preparedness, and environmental issues. Furthermore, Baklanov 
(2011) recently shared results of the EU MEGAPOLI project (Megacities: Emissions, Impact 
on Air Quality and Climate, and Improved Tools for Mitigation and Assessment), which 
focuses on the multiple spatial and temporal scales from street to global levels and vice 
versa. The project addresses megacities with air quality and climate having complex effects 
on each other. Another EU-funded project CityZen (Megacities: Zoom for the Environment) 
also focused on impact of megacities on their environment and climate and vice versa from 
local to global aspects using long-term ground and satellite observations as well as regional 
and global modeling. 
2. Megacities and air quality 
As of 2011, there are 26 megacities in the world such as Tokyo, Guangzhou, Seoul, Delhi, 
Mumbai, Mexico City, New York City, Sao Paulo, Istanbul and other sixteen , eight of

which exceeds 20 million. Fig. 1 presents the population in megacities world-wide with 
their continents. The four of the megacities are located at the South Hemisphere. Fifteen 
megacities are located at the tropical and humids-subtropical regions. This characteristic 
is important due to the growing evidence of the climate–health relationships posing 
increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming 
trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in 
many regions of the world (Patz, et al., 2005). A total of 14 megacities, corresponding to 
more than of 50% of the total megacities, are located at the Asia continent, particularly in 
south and east parts. In this very dynamic region of the world, there are significant 
increases in industrialization and urbanization enhanced the urban population growth 
and economic development. This also leads to drastic increases in energy consumption 
and pollutant emissions in these regions. As an example, China is a rapid developing 
country with an urban population rate that increased from 19.6% to 46% within the last 
three decades. 
 
Fig. 1. Populations of the megacities with respect to their continents. 
According to “China’s blue paper”, urban population ratio will reach 65% by 2030 in China. 
In recent years, a remarkable increase in the number of studies for air quality in China has 
been conducted (Kai et al., 2007; Chan and Yao, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2009; Wang 
et al, 2010;Zhu et al., 2011; Jahn et al., 2011). As an example, Chan and Yao (2008) extensively 
discussed the urbanization and air quality characteristics in Beijing, Shanghai and cities in 
Pearl River Delta (PRD) which is the mainland of China’s leading commercial and 
manufacturing region covering Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. They noticed that in 
spite of the much attention to reduce emissions through effective control measures, 
particulate pollution is still severe in megacities of China. Among them, Guangzhou, which 
is the fourth largest city in China, is the main manufacturing hub of the PRD. In this city, the 
major industries are located in this industrial zone. In an earlier study by Kai et al. (2007) Air 
Pollution Index (API) values of Guangzhou were compared with the values of Shanghai and 
Beijing. The API for Guangzhou is higher than those of Beijing and Shanghai indicating that 
TSP was the prominent pollutant accounting for 62% of the major share in Guangzhou

(Zhou et al., 2007). In order to improve the air quality in Guangzhou, several new strategic 
efforts have been planned and established in industry and transportation sectors. Examples 
of the new control measures in transportation are; the metro line, which was opened in 1997, 
bus rapid transit system, hybrid buses, and design of low-emission zones in busy traffic areas. 
In a very recent study, Zhu et al. (2011) investigated the transport pathways and potential 
sources of PM10 in Beijing.  
On the contrary to the classical air pollution events in megacities that are above mentioned, 
Los Angeles, USA (34o03’N; 118o15’W) which is in a large basin surrounded by the Pacific 
Ocean to the west and several mountain peaks to the east and south, and having a 
population of over 18 million, remains the most ozone-polluted region in the country. The 
Los Angeles region, which has a subtropical Mediterranean climate, enjoys plenty of 
sunshine throughout the year. The frequent sunny days and low rainfall contribute to ozone 
formation and accumulation as well as high levels of fine particles and dust in Los Angeles. 
The city area has the highest levels of ozone nationwide, violating federal health standards 
with an average of 137 days a year. The population growth, dependence on private motor 
vehicles, and adverse natural meteorological conditions can lead the episodic air quality 
levels in this area. 
2.1 The general characteristics of air pollution and emission sources in megacities 
Air pollution in urban areas comes from a wide variety of sources. The sources responsable 
for high emission loads are grouped into several sectors such as transport, domestic 
commercial and industrial activities for anthropogenic sources and NMVOCs from biogenic 
sources. Transport sector includes mainly motor vehicles, trains, aircraft, ship and boats 
while industry and domestic activities include fuel combustion including wood, coal, and 
gas for heating and production. Besides, biogenic (natural) emissions include NOx and VOC 
emissions from vegetation and soils (Guenther et al., 2006). Today, urban air quality is a 
major concern throughout the world. Molina (2002) indicated that the quality of the air we 
breathe is fundamental to the quality of life for the growing millions of people living in the 
world's burgeoning megacities and deteriorating urban air quality threatens the public 
health. Furthermore, airborne emissions from major urban and industrial areas influence 
both air quality and climate change. This challenge is particularly acute in the developing 
world where the rapid growth of megacities is producing atmospheric pollution of 
unprecedented severity and extent. Mage et al. (1996) reviewed the difficulties in finding 
solutions to the air pollution in the megacities. Baldasano et al. (2003) examined the air 
quality for the principal cities in developed and developing countries. According to the 
study, the current state of air quality worldwide indicates that SO2 maintains a downward 
tendency throughout the world, with the exception of some Central American and Asian 
cities, whereas NO2 maintains levels very close to the WHO guideline value in many cities. 
However, in certain cities such as Kiev, Beijing and Guangzhou, the figures are 
approximately three times higher than the WHO guideline value. In the Asian databases 
consulted, only Japan showed really low figures. Surface ozone levels presents average 
values that exceed the selected guideline values in all of the analysis by regions, income 
level and number of inhabitants, demonstrating that this is a global problem with 
consequences for rich and poor countries, large and medium cities and all the regions.

Gurjar et al. (2008) examined the emissions and air quality pertaining to the megacities. He 
and his colleagues ranked megacities in terms of their trace gas and particle emissions and 
ambient air quality, based on the newly proposed multi-pollutant index (MPI) which 
considers the combined level of the three criterion pollutants (TSP, SO2 and NO2) in view of 
the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for air quality. Simulations of the export of 
air pollution from megacities to downwind locations via long-range transport (LRT) have 
shown different transport patterns depending on the megacity location: in the tropics export is 
occurring mostly via the free troposphere, whereas at mid and high latitudes it occurs within 
the lowest troposphere (Lawrence et al., 2007). Butler & Lawrence (2009) simulated small 
impacts of megacities on the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and larger on reactive 
nitrogen species on global scale. They also pointed out the need of parameterization of the sub-
grid effects of megacities. Butler et al. (2008) analyzed different emission inventories and found 
substantial differences in emission’s geographical distribution within countries even if the 
country total emissions are the same. They also reported large differences in the contribution 
of various sectors to the total emissions from each city. 
Table 1 presents the megacities with their location, climate type, major emissions and 
critical air quality parameters. As seen in Table 1, there is a significant geographical 
variation in domestic heating emissions. Specifically, particulate matter is a major 
problem in almost all of Asian and Latin cities. In all of the megacities, emissions from the 
motor vehicles are a major contributor of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and 
particulate matter. The most important source for the classical pollutants such as 
particular matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic 
compounds are combustion of fossil fuels.  
3. Megacity of Beijing 
Beijing (39°54′N; 116°23′E), the capital of China, has completed its third decade of 
economic development known as the Economic Reform and Open Policy starting in 1978, 
and is a rapidly developing megacity with a 16 million population (Fang et al., 2009). As 
it’s the capital city, Beijing continues to experience substantial growth in population, 
economic activity, business, travel and tourism. The city is situated at the northern tip of 
the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. 
Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's 
agricultural areas from the desert steppes. Beijing has been experiencing severe 
anthropogenic air pollution problems since 1980s due to the significant energy 
consumption depending on developments of the city. Furthermore, natural sources have a 
significant impact on the city environment such as dust transport from the northern parts 
of the city. This leads to polluted smog covering the city as a thick blanket under specific 
meteorological conditions. 
3.1 Climate 
Beijing is in a warm temperate zone and has a typical monsoon–influenced humid 
continental climate with four distinct seasons. It is usually characterized by hot and humid 
summers and dry winters.

3.2 Air pollution sources 
The major anthropogenic emission sources in Beijing are domestic heating, traffic and 
industry. Coal dominated energy structure is also one of the major causes of air pollution in 
Beijing (Hao, et al., 2007). As an example to the total emissions from energy production 
sector of 16.0 GWh/y, Hao et al. (2007) calculated a 102,497 t/y of SO2, 60,567 t/y of NOx 
and 11,633 t/y of PM10. Domestic heating in Beijing usually starts in mid-November and 
ends in the following March and it is the major source for SO2 in the winter season (Chan 
and Yao, 2008; Hao et al., 2005). Furthermore, industrial emissions emitted from Shijingshan 
region, located west of Beijing, are significant sources of particulate matter in Beijing. Beijing 
experiences a serious urban sprawl which has been claimed to be a major factor leading to 
the need for long-distance travel, congestion in the city centre and private vehicle usage 
problem (Zhao, et al., 2010; Deng & Huang, 2004). The number of cars in Beijing has grown 
rapidly and reached to 4.76 million vehicles in 2011, up from 1.5 million in 2000 and 2.6 
million in 2005, according to official statistics provided by the municipal transportation 
authorities. Particulate matter emitted from motor vehicles and re-suspension of road dust 
are also likely contributors to PM10 pollution in the city (Song et al., 2006). Last but not least, 
natural dust originating from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China 
results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city.  
3.3 Air quality in Beijing 
Beijing is party to the Standard Ambient Air Quality Standards (GB 3095-1996), which sets 
limits for SO2, CO, PM10 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The Chinese air quality standards set 
separate limits for different types of areas such as Class I, II and III based on physical 
characteristics of the region such as natural conservation areas and special industrial areas. 
Beijing is designated as a Class II area, which applies to residential, mixed commercial/ 
residential, cultural, industrial, and rural areas. 
TSP and SO2 have been the major pollutants in China for a long time due to the fossil fuel 
burning from power plants, industry and domestic heating. However, in recent years, the 
Chinese Government have planned to reveal a major environmental plan to help managing 
air pollution and is expected to include efforts to reduce pollution through new regulations 
and strategies including taxes and investments in this field. As an example, energy-related 
measures include fuel substitution and flue gas desulfurization facilities, which were built at 
the coal fired power plants, control measures such as energy efficiency and fuel use and 
dust control improvements (Hao et al. 2007). Initiatives have also been implemented in 
Beijing. The use of natural gas has been increased four-fold from 2000 as a result of efforts 
made to replace coal fired boilers and family stoves to use natural gas, and coal heating with 
electrical heating. As a result of these initiatives, from 1990 to 1999, the annual average TSP 
concentration in 100 major cities decreased by 30% to 256 μg/m3 and it remained almost 
constant from 1999 to 2003 (Sinton et al., 2004), despite an overall decrease of 30% in total 
energy consumption from 1997 to 2002. Fang et al. (2009) examined the air quality 
management in China and the changing air quality levels with their reasons. The results of 
the new strategies in Beijing are seen in Fig.2. In 1998, Beijing started its phased intensive 
control program to fight air pollution. PM10 concentrations increased by around 10% from 
2003 to 2006 because of the increase in coal-fired boiler emissions, construction activities and 
dust storms (United Nations Environment Program, 2007). The annual PM10 concentrations

Air Pollution in Mega Cities: A Case Study of Istanbul 
 
85 
in Beijing decreased from 162μg/m3 in 2006 to 141μg/m3 in 2007 despite an increase in 
energy consumption. The recent measurements of PM10 indicates lower levels such as 
123μg/m3 in 2008; 120μg/m3 in 2009, respectively. One of the reasons of the high level of 
PM10 is residential coal-combustion in Beijing. SO2 emissions from residential coal-
combustion in Beijing were increased from 68,800 tons in 2003 to 85,100 tons in 2005. The 
expansion of the urban areas and the increase in SO2 emissions led to increased particulate 
sulfate concentrations, which resulted in higher PM10 levels. However, SO2 levels in the city 
are decreasing (Fang et al., 2009). Furthermore, Beijing experiences high PM10 pollution 
during spring dust storms. Zhu et al. (2011) showed that the typical wind speed of such dust 
storms is approximately 7 m/s or more, and the sand and dust sources are located about 
1000-2000 km northwest of Beijing. According to Zhu et al. (2011), dust storms can reach to 
Beijing within 3 days.

Recently, heavy industries have been gradually replaced by less polluting industries in 
Beijing. Besides, several possible activities are planned on major polluting industries such as 
the closure of cookery units at coke and chemical plants as well as closure of cement, lime 
and brick plants. The, transport sector is also a major contributor to Beijing’s air quality. In 
this sector, stringent vehicle emission standards have been established. The Beijing 
municipal government will also implement traffic control measures such as the 
improvement of fuel quality to meet the new emission standards and to ease the city's traffic 
congestion.

consists of Cario, Giza and Kalubia, and has a population of about 17 million inhabitants. 
The city which about one-third of Egypt’s population and 60% of its industry and is one of 
the world’s most densely populated cities. Gurjar, (2009) and Decker et al., (2000) reported 
that Cairo’s population is confined in 214 km2 area making it the most densely populated 
megacity. The urbanization and industrialzation have increased very rapidly in Greater 
Cairo, particularly in the second half of the last century. 
4.1 Climate 
The climate in Cairo and along the Nile River Valley is characterized by a hot, dry desert 
climate. Wind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the spring. 
Abu-Allaban et al. (2002; 2007 and 2009) reported that wind speeds in wintertime is weaker 
than during summer, implying a lower ventilation of the area during winter that could 
favor pollutant accumulation in the vicinity of the sources. Additionally, Safar and Lebib 
(2010) indicated that the arid climate in the city causes a persistent high background PM 
level in the Cairo area.  
4.2 Air pollutant emissions 
The air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. The major emissions in the city 
come from industry and motor vehicles which cause high ambient concentrations of PM, 
SO2, NOx and CO. There are over 4.5 million cars on the streets of Cairo according to recent 
records. The relative contribution to particulate pollution from different economic activities 
is shown in Table 2. As seen in the table, the major contribution to the particulate load is 
urban solid waste burning by 30%. Transport and industry follows the solid waste by 26% 
and 23%, respectively. Kanakidou et al. (2011) summarized a comprehensive overview of 
the actual knowledge on the atmospheric pollutant sources, and the levels in the Eastern 
Mediterranean cities including Cairo. The annual sectoral distribution of pollutants are 
calculated for Cairo based on 2005 year as the reference year. Road transport and residential 
activities are important sources of PM and responsible for almost 35.9% and 53.4% of the 
PM10 emissions, respectively. Industrial activities have a major part for the SO2 with 71.5% 
(Kanakidou et al., 2011). Furthermore, a typical black cloud appears over Cairo and rural 
regions of the Nile Delta in every fall due to biomass burning. It is found that this event is a 
major contributor to the local air quality. Molina and Molina (2004) explained the black 
cloud in Cairo during fall season based on the open burning of agricultural waste (mostly 
burning of rice harvest by farmers to clear fields for the next harvest in rural areas of Nile 
Delta). Additionally, traffic, industrial emissions and secondary aerosols was attributed to 
the black cloud events. Prasat et al. (2010) indicated the long range transport of dust at high 
altitudes (2.5–6 km) from Western Sahara and its deposition over the Nile Delta region. New 
evidence of the desert dust transported from Western Sahara to Nile Delta during black 
cloud season and its significance for regional aerosols have potential impact on the regional 
climate. Recently, the European Investment Bank approved a 90,000 EURO grant in order to 
investigate methods to reduce the burning of rice straw, which is thought to be one of the 
potential sources of these clouds (UN and League of Arap States Report, 2006). In addition 
to all, Cairo is the only city in Africa having a metro system (about 42 km length and 
carrying 60,000 passengers per hour in each direction).

Table 2. Relative contributions to particulate pollution from different economic activities in 
Cairo (EEPP-Air, 2004). 
4.3 Air quality in Cairo 
Air quality in Greater Cairo is a major concern to the Government of Egypt, particularly 
with regard to adverse health impacts. According to Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS) 
for WHO and the Egypt Report (2010), particulate matter and lead pollution have been 
recognized as the most significant pollutants threatening health in Cairo causing at least 
about 6,000 premature deaths annually and about 5,000 excess cancer cases over the 
lifetimes of current Cairo residents. Under this framework, PM10 is the most critical air 
quality problem in Egypt. Windblown dusts particles were significantly contributed the 
PM levels in Cairo and surrounding areas (EEPP-Air, 2004). A comprehensive national air 
quality monitoring system has been recently established in Egypt as part of 
Environmental Information and Monitoring Program and implemented with support 
from the Danish Government. The monitoring system has been operational for the 
measurements of common air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and PM10. This is 
carried out by 42 monitoring stations throughout the country with one-third of them 
located in Cairo. 
In recent two decades, several studies are published in the literature about the air pollution 
in Cairo (Zakey& Omran, 1997; Abu-Allaban et al., 2007; Favez et al., 2008, Zakey et al., 
2008; Mahmoud et al., 2008; Safar & Labip, 2010). These studies include both anthropogenic 
and natural contributions to air quality in Cairo. As an example, Zakey & Omran (1997) 
showed that the dust and sand storms frequently occur specifically in spring and autumn 
and hot desert cyclones known as the “Khamasin” depressions pass over the desert during 
spring months. Hot and dry winds can often carry the dust and sand particulates to the city 
and they increase PM levels in the Cairo atmosphere. A source attribution study was 
performed by Abu-Allaban et al. (2007) where they used the chemical mass balance receptor 
modeling order to examine the sources of PM10 and PM2.5 in Cairo’s ambient atmosphere. 
They found that major contributors to PM10 included geological material, mobile source 
emissions, and open burning. PM2.5 tended to be dominated by mobile source emissions, 
open burning, and secondary species. Favez et al. (2008) examined the seasonality of major 
aerosol species and their transformations in Cairo. Mahmoud et al. (2008) investigated the 
origins of black carbon concentration peaks in Cairo atmosphere. Seasonal and spatial 
variation of particulate matters was examined in Cairo by Zakey et al. (2008). They indicated 
that the highest recorded PM10 values were found in industrial and heavy traffic locations. 
The annual mean PM2.5 and PM10 are observed to be 85 and 175 μg/m3, respectively) due to 
the traffic emissions and burning of waste materials. Recently, Safar&Labip (2010) 
investigated health risk assessments of PM and lead in Cairo. They showed that due to the 
arid climate, there is a persistent high background PM level in this area. This is one of the 
reasons of the high daily PM10 levels that is above the air quality limits in the country. From 
the meteorological conditions view, Cairo has very poor dispersion characteristics. Irregular 
settlements, layout of tall buildings and narrow streets create a bowl effect in the city

environment. The high levels of lead were recorded in the major Egyptian cities. 
Safar&Labip (2010) explained that the lead levels in Cairo are among the highest in the 
world. The maximum annual average concentration of lead is found in the Shoubra Kheima 
industrialized region due to the lead smelters in this area during the period of 1998 through 
2007. The highest annual average Pb levels recorded were 26.2 and 25.4 μg/m3 at the 
Shoubra Kheima and El Sahel monitoring stations, respectively, during the baseline year 
(October 98 to September 99). The annual average Pb levels have been gradually decreased 
when the lead smelters in the area were closed and moved to the industrial area of Abou 
Zaabal. CCS (2010) report indicated that lead was completely phased out from petrol 
distributed in Cairo, Alexandria and most of the cities of Lower Egypt in late 1997, and 
consequently, lead concentration in the atmosphere of Cairo city centre and residential areas 
gradually decreased. Surface ozone levels were also examined in Cairo. Gusten et al. (1994) 
studied the ozone formation in the Greater Cairo in 1990. The peak values of 120 ppb and 
daily mean value of 50 ppb throughout the year indicate a substantial contribution of 
photochemistry to the ozone content of the atmosphere. It is estimated that the ozone is 
produced predominantly over the industrial area in the north and in the centre of Cairo and 
transported southward by the prevailing northerly winds. Contrary to many urban areas in 
Europe and in North America, fairly high average ozone levels of 40 ppb are observed 
during the night throughout the spring and the summer. This may imply that health 
hazards and crop damage may be higher in the greater Cairo area than in Central Europe. 
Recently, Mi (2009) examined the diurnal, seasonal and weekdays-weekends variations of 
ground level ozone concentrations in an urban area in Greater Cairo (Haram, Giza). He 
found that the daytime (8-h) mean values of wintertime and summertime O3 were 44 ppb 
and 91 ppb, respectively. Besides, he reported that the highest levels of NOx were found in 
winter. The concentrations of O3 precursors (NO and NO2) in weekends were lower than 
those found in weekdays, whereas the O3 levels during the weekends were high compared 
with weekdays. 
In order to enhance the air quality in Cairo atmosphere, there are several efforts under the 
new strategy by the Government such as switching to natural gas in industrial, residential 
and transport sectors. Policies to remove old fleet of vehicles from the streets and to promote 
public transport especially through the expansion of underground metro, enhancement of 
solid waste management, banning of the open air burning of solid waste are also among the 
major strategies.  
5. Megacity of Delhi  
Delhi (28o36’N; 77o13’E) is the second largest metropolitan in India. The name Delhi is often 
used to refer both to the urban areas near the National Capital Territory of Delhi and New 
Delhi, the capital of India, which is surrounded by other major urban agglomerations of 
adjoining states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (National Summary Report, 2010). The 
National Capital Territory of Delhi is spread over an area of 1484 km2. There are three local 
bodies in Delhi. Municipal Corporation of Delhi which is the major one has an area of 1397 
km2 and the two small areas are New Delhi Municipal Committee and Delhi Cantonment 
Board. Its population has increased from 9.4 million in 1991 to 18.9 million in 2010. 
Presently, about 30% of the population lives in squatter settlements. The number of 
industrial units in Delhi in 1951 was approximately 8,000. By 1991 this number had

--- Page 13 ---
 
Air Pollution in Mega Cities: A Case Study of Istanbul 
 
89 
increased to more than 125,000. The vehicular population has increased phenomenally, from 
235,000 in 1975 to 2,629,000 in 1996, and closed to touch 6 million in 2011. In 1975 the 
vehicular population in Delhi and Mumbai was about the same; today Delhi has three times 
more vehicles than Mumbai.  
5.1 Climate 
The climate of Delhi is a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate with an extremely 
hot summer, and cold winters. Delhi has relatively dry winters and has a prolonged spell of 
very hot weather. Delhi usually experiences surface inversions and heavy fog events during 
the winter season. This leads to restriction of dilution of the emissions from specifically 
motor vehicles and episodic events in Delhi. In December, reduced visibility leads to 
disruption of road, air and rail traffic. Molina & Molina (2004) explained that during 
summer, large amounts of wind-blown dust carried by strong westerly winds from the Thar 
Desert result in elevated PM levels. These dust storm periods are followed by the monsoon 
season (July to mid-September), which is the least polluted season due to the heavy 
monsoon rains that wash out the pollutants.  
5.2 Air pollution sources 
The major air pollution sources in Delhi are motor vehicles and industry. The number of 
industrial units in Delhi increased from 8,000 in 1951 to 125,000 in 1991 while automobile 
vehicles increased from 235,000 in 1975 to 4,5 million in 2004 (Government of India, 2006). 
The vehicular pollution contributes 67% of the total air pollution load (approx.3 Mt per day) 
in Delhi and its sharing is rapidly growing (Narain & Krupnick, 2007). The 25% of air 
pollution is generated by industry and coal based thermal power plants. The three power 
plants in Delhi generate approximately 6,000 Mt of fly ash per day. Industrial effluent load 
is about 320 Mt per day. Municipal solid waste generation is also estimated to be 5,000 Mt 
per day.  
5.3 Air quality in Delhi 
Delhi is the fourth most polluted megacity in the world. Air quality in Delhi is poor and 
airborne concentrations of major air pollutants frequently exceed National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (NAAQS) set by India’s Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) (The 
Ministry of Environment and Forests, National Ambient Air Quality Standards 2009) A 
number of studies have analyzed air pollution data for Delhi. Delhi’s annual mean PM10 
concentration is highest among major Asian cities, and was between three and four times 
the Indian standard during 2001–2004 (HEI, 2004). A summary of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and 
SO2 levels for different stations (background, residential, industry and kerbside) and 
different seasons (winter, post monsoon, and summer) in Delhi is given in Table 3. As 
seen in Table 3, almost at all locations and in all seasons, standards of PM10 and PM2.5 
have been exceeded (except for the industrial area). Even the background locations are 
highly polluted because these locations also fall within the city area and are impacted 
from the city emissions. PM10 contribution is mainly originated from heavy duty diesel 
vehicles.

Table 3. Average air quality levels (μg/m3) in Delhi at background, residential, industry 
and kerbside areas for winter, post monsoon and summer periods of 2007 (Nat.Rep., 2010). 
It can also be seen that in terms of PM levels, Delhi shows highest air pollution levels during 
post-monsoon. Observations at Delhi show much higher variability according to the 
characteristics of the monitoring station area. NO2 levels are exceeded at the residential area 
sites in Delhi (35%), NO2 levels generally exceed the ambient air quality standards at 
kerbside locations, particularly during winter and post monsoon seasons at Delhi by 85 – 
95%.This analysis shows that PM problem is severe and NO2 is the emerging pollutant that 
requires immediate planning to control its emissions. NO2 is mainly contributed by man-
made sources such as vehicles, industry and other fuel combustion activities. Delhi exhibits 
high percentage of NO2 from energy production owing to presence of power plants. Fig. 3 
presents the trend of annual variation of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM or 
PM10), SO2 and NO2 in Delhi in 2001-2008. The annual average RSPM and NO2 
concentrations are increasing in Delhi while SO2 values are declining due to the low sulfur 
fuel use in power plants. Other fuels consumed in domestic use and, in some cities, for 
vehicles, are LPG and CNG respectively.

6. Megacity of Istanbul 
6.1 Introduction 
Air pollution problem in Istanbul has received wide public attention since the 1980s and has 
remained the focal point among Turkey’s environmental problems. In the late 1980s and 
beginning of 1990s, Istanbul has experienced significant particulate matter and sulfur 
dioxide episodes due to the fossil fuel burning for domestic heating and industry. Following 
the fuel switching policy, particulate matter concentrations and sulfur dioxide levels were 
gradually decreased in the city. However, today the city is facing specifically secondary 
particulate matter and NOx problems depending on the emission sources. In this part of this 
chapter, firstly, a general description of the topography and meteorology of Istanbul, 
emission sources, and the spatial and temporal variations of the pollutants, particularly 
PM10 and SO2, in the city will be provided that will be followed by a description of the 
recent emission inventory preparations. Surface ozone and its precursors in the city are also 
discussed. Additionally, meteorological characteristics leading to air pollution episodes will 
be extensively presented. 
Istanbul is one of the significant and historically ancient megacities in the world with 13.2 
million inhabitants and has an area of 5343 km2 covering 39 districts. The city is the center 
of industry, economics, finance and culture in Turkey. Istanbul generates about 55% of 
Turkey’s trade and produces 27.5% of Turkey’s national product. This lovely city has been 
associated with major political, religious and artistic events for more than 2,000 years. 
Recently, historical areas of the city have been added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage.  
6.2 Topography and climate 
Istanbul is located at 41oN and 29oE and is in the NW of Turkey’s from the Black Sea to 
Marmara. The Bosphorus channel separates the city to Asian and European parts on the 
direction of NNE/SSW (Fig.4). The Bosphorus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea. 
The city also encompasses a natural harbor known as the Golden Horn in the northwest. 
The historic peninsula in the European part of the city is built on seven hills and surrounded 
by historical city walls. There are two significant hills in the city. The highest points in 
Istanbul are Yakacık (420m) and Aydos (537m) hills in Kartal province and Camlıca hill 
(288m) nearby the Bosphorus, on the Asian sides.  
Istanbul has Mediterranean climate in temperate zone with four distinct seasons. Summer 
months (June-July-August) are relatively dry and warm while winter months (December, 
January, February) are mild and rainy. The lowest monthly average temperature is 6.5oC in 
January and the highest monthly average temperature is 22.7oC in July. Domestic heating in 
Istanbul usually starts in early-November and ends in the late March and early-April. There 
are also around 124 rainy days with a total precipitation of 843 mm. Most of the rain comes 
in winter season. Istanbul is humid and monthly average RH is 75%. RH exceeds 80% in 
most winter months. Besides, irradiation is strong with average daily values in summer by 
approximately 21 MJ/m2, and sunshine duration is 2460 hours annually. The prevailing 
wind directions are north-easterly and south-westerly in winter, and northerly in summer, 
especially when the Etesian system controls the weather in the region (Unal et al., 2000). 
However, the prevailing wind direction varies from north northeast to northeast and south 
southwest in the winter and varies from north northeast, northeast and east-northeast in the

summer with moderate wind speeds. The urban area in Istanbul has continuously expanded 
to the suburbs.  
  
Fig. 4. A map of Istanbul with air quality measurement stations. 
6.3 Emission sources 
Emission sources in Istanbul have shown significant changes over time. While today, traffic, 
industrial processes, domestic heating, road dust and biogenic emissions are the most 
significant emission sources, domestic heating and industry was the major emission sources 
before two decades ago in the city. 
Istanbul has experienced a complicated period from an ancient metropolis to a sprawling 
megacity, growing from just over 2 million inhabitants in 1970 to 13.2 million today. 
However, due to the migration from the other cities its population has increased more than 
six fold between 1970 and 2010 (Tayanc et al., 2009). Rapid urbanization and development of 
society and economy, with the increased migration from the less developed regions of the 
country at the end of the 1980s caused a significant increase in the population and an 
expansion of the built-up areas in the city. Not only the rapid increase of the urban 
population due to influx of the people from other cities, but also the establishment of many 
small and medium sized industries in and around Istanbul, caused many environmental 
problems. Atimtay and Incecik (2004) extensively discussed the period of 1970-1980s. The 
industrial as well as the domestic heating mostly burned fuel oil to produce energy before 
1970’s. Following the energy crises of 1970’s, due to the tremendous increase in the oil 
prices, the preferred fuel in the city was coal. The coal used was mostly local Turkish lignite 
with high in sulfur and ash content, but low in calorific value. In those days there was not 
any regulation on air pollution control. The First Environmental Law was accepted in 1983 
and the first Air Pollution Control Regulation was entered in force in 1986. The very active 
period involving the banning of lignite, natural gas agreement, establishing of gas 
distribution company (IGDAS) and starting the operations for infrastructure followed the 
regulation. IGDAŞ started to distribute natural gas on January 1992, first on the Asian side

93 
of the city and then expanded to the metropolitan area (Atimtay&Incecik, 2004). Today 95% 
of the total gas is used for domestic heating and industry purposes. 
As one of the major emission sources, traffic was the secondary source in 1980s. Following 
1980s the number of motor vehicles on Istanbul’s streets has increased even faster than its 
population growing since 1980. It was only about 0.3 million cars in 1980, but now it is 
closing three million (about 2.72 million vehicles are registered based on the 2010 figures). 
Every day more than 700 new cars enter to the Istanbul streets. About 60% of these vehicles 
are operated by gasoline and 40% by diesel. PM10 emissions on traffic originate from diesel 
vehicles rather than the gasoline powered ones. Besides, most of the heavy vehicles, such as 
buses and commercial vehicles in transport and construction sectors, are powered by the 
diesel system. Furthermore, following the 1999, liquefied petroleum gas has been widely 
used in traffic. Istanbul Chamber of Industry reported and Im et al., 2006; Kanakidou et al. 
(2011) used that the low quality solid and liquid fuels with high sulfur content, natural gas 
and LPG are the most commonly used fuel types in the industrial activities including textile, 
metal, chemical, food and other industries. Istanbul is on the two transit motorways passing 
over the city connections between Europe and Asia on the east-west direction by the 
Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridges. The total length of roads and highways has 
significantly increased from 1980s within three decades while the number of vehicles has 
increased. The city traffic much more depends on the two bridges in the city. The number of 
vehicles crossing the two bridges has increased approximately 25% from 2001 (120,000 
vehicles) to 2010 (150,000 vehicles) (KGM, 2011). Hence, traffic emissions are elevated 
significantly within the past decade. Recently, Turkey adopted the Euro 4 standards to 
reduce vehicular emissions of air pollutants in the beginning of 2009. Istanbul has a metro 
with 16 km long in the European side and it is still expanding. On the Asian side, a new 
metro construction continues and is scheduled to be opened in 2013. Furthermore, a Bus 
Rapid Transit (BRT) system established in 2009 connecting the both side of the city from far 
west (Avcılar) to Sogutlucesme (Kadikoy) with about 30 km. Istanbul will be connected at 
soon with an underwater tunnel. The construction is currently in progress and underwater 
rail tunnel (Marmaray) will be open in 2013.  
There are three industrial zones in the city for small and medium-scale industrial 
operations. They are located at both sides of the city. There are two busy international 
airports. One is located at the European part (Atatürk Airport) and the other is Sabiha 
Gokcen Airport at the Asian part (Fig. 4). Atatürk International Airport is ranked 34th in the 
busiest airports of the world with a passenger traffic of 32.1 million. Sabiha Gokcen Airport 
serves many domestic and some low-fare international flights, with about 104,000 total 
aircraft movements annually. Istanbul experiences frequently dust transport coming from 
the Sahara. Karaca et al. (2009), Celebi et al. (2010) and Kocak et al. (2011) showed that air 
parcels arriving in Istanbul in the spring months are mainly from the Sahara. Nevertheless, 
even limited amounts coal is consumed for domestic heating in winter months; it causes 
significant particular matter pollution problems at some residential areas in the city where 
mostly illegal squatter settlements are located.  
6.4 Emission inventory preparations 
Emission inventory has always been a significant problem in Istanbul. In recent decade, 
there were several efforts on the emission inventory preparations for Istanbul

Metropolitan area. In 2005, EMBARQ and Istanbul’s Directorate General of Environmental 
Protection launched an ambitious initiative to reduce air pollution in the city considering 
reducing transport emissions. In addition, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has 
developed an “Istanbul Air Quality Strategy Report” emissions inventory of air pollutants 
(IBB, 2009). The local emissions inventory was based on a European Union project in the 
scope of the EU Life Program has been implemented in a partnership of Istanbul 
Metropolitan Municipality and Dokuz Eylül University (Elbir, 2010). In this project, local 
emission inventory was prepared with 1-hour temporal and 1-km spatial resolution 
within an area of 170 km by 85 km centered at the metropolitan area of Istanbul. In a 
systematic way, the emission sources are broadly categorized as point, line and area 
sources, covering industrial, vehicular and domestic sources respectively. Five major 
pollutants consisting of particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide 
(CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
emitted through these sources were identified (IBB, 2009). As seen in Table 4, industry is 
the most polluting sector for SO2 contributing to about 83% of total emissions while 
domestic heating is the most polluting sector for PM10 contributing to 51% of total 
emissions. Traffic is also the most polluting sector for NOx, and CO emissions with the 
contributions of 89% and 68%, respectively.

Table 4. Sectoral emissions in Istanbul (IBB, 2009). 
Furthermore, in recent years, there are important efforts on higher resolution (in high spatial 
(2 × 2 km2) and temporal resolutions) detailed emission inventories of anthropogenic 
sources studies. Markakis et al. (2012) developed high resolution emission inventory for 
2007 reference year as annual sectoral distribution of pollutants; and cited by Im et al. (2010 
and 2011) and Kanakidou et al, (2011). The sectoral distributions of these emissions is 
presented in Table 5. Im et al. (2010) showed that wintertime PM10 episodes can be 
explained almost entirely by the local anthropogenic sources. Kocak et al. (2011) confirmed 
this finding by the PMF analysis conducted on the chemical composition data provided by 
Theodosi et al. (2010). The emissions are spatially allocated on the cells using a grid spacing 
of 2 km over the Istanbul. The pollutants considered are NOx, CO, SOx, NH3, NMVOCs, 
PM10 and PM2.5. The NMVOCs emissions are chemically speciated in 23 species based on 
Olivier et al. (2002) and Visschedijk et al. (2005) source sectoral profiles (CARB, 2007). PM10 
emissions were chemically speciated in organic and elemental carbon, nitrates, sulfates, 
ammonium and other particles. According to Markakais et al. (2012) and Kanakidou et al. 
(2011), CO and NOx are the major emissions for road transport by 83.1% and 79.4%, 
respectively. Industry has also major contributer for PM10 by 64.9% and SO2 by 23.2%, 
respectively. However, shipping emissions in Istanbul is gradually increasing. Because,

Bosphorus Istanbul has a busy ship traffic. Recently, there are about 60,000 ships passing 
yearly from the Bosphorus channel (Kesgin and Vardar, 2001; Deniz and Durmusoglu, 2008; 
Incecik et al., 2010). Kanakidou et al. (2011) presents significant contribution of shipping to 
SO2 emissions by 17.6% and NOx by 9.5 and PM10 by 3.1%.

6.5 Air quality in Istanbul 
6.5.1 Monitoring network  
The first air pollution monitoring network was designed to measure SO2 and suspended 
particulate matter (TSP) concentrations in the air in 1985 with 7 stations in the city by the 
Ministry of Health (Hifzisihha Institute). The network provided daily SO2 and TSP 
measurements. In this network, daily values of TSP concentrations were measured by the 
reflectivity method and SO2 concentrations were measured with the West-Geake method. In 
mid-1989, 10 more stations were established in the city. In 1998, the Greater Istanbul 
Municipality established a separate air pollution monitoring network in the city. The new 
network system consists of 10 measuring sites located in residential, commercial and 
industrial parts of the city. The new network measures air pollution parameters on hourly 
basis. Conventional parameters of PM10, which is replaced with TSP and SO2, are measured 
in all stations. CO, NOx are only measured in four stations.  Surface ozone was measured at 
two stations in 1999-2005 and then continued with one station. Now, O3 is being measured 
at two stations in the city. However, understanding of air quality in megacities requires high 
spatial resolution of the monitoring network. For this purpose, in frame of a new European 
Project (SIPA), about 36 stations including urban, semi urban and rural are being launched 
in Istanbul and Marmara areas.  
6.6 Temporal and spatial variation of air quality 
The first measurements showed that Istanbul has a serious air pollution problem due to 
domestic heating, industry and traffic (Incecik, 1996; Tayanc, 2000; Topcu et al.,2001). The 
pollution was more severe especially in the regions of densely populated settlements. 
Uncontrolled expansion of the city in 1980s also caused severe air pollution problems in

certain areas. City regulations banning usage of less efficient, poor-quality lignite for heating 
purposes was inadequate. Fig.5 presents the first results of the measurements as annual 
average SO2 and TSP concentrations in the city. As can be seen in the figure, both SO2 and 
TSP levels were much higher than the air quality standards and WHO guidelines. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5. Annual mean values of daily SO2 and TSP concentrations in Istanbul for the polluted 
period 1985-1994. 
Incecik (1996) extensively examined the air quality levels and atmospheric conditions 
leading to air pollution episodes in winter months of 1985-1991 periods. Incecik (1996) 
showed that anticyclonic pressure patterns and lower surface wind speeds lead to 
unfavorable conditions for air pollution potential over the city. Poor quality fuel used in the 
city was the major reason of the dramatic levels of SO2 and TSP in the winter months. 
Furthermore, he examined the ratios of January/July SO2 and TSP concentrations during the 
1985-1994 periods. The ratios for SO2 an TSP presented and increase from 1.4 to 13.6 and 2.3 
to 8.8, respectively in the study period. Besides, it is shown that the higher pollutant 
concentrations in cool seasons might also be related to the generally stable atmosphere, 
which limits the volume of air into which emissions from the local emissions are dispersed.

The relationship between occurrence of the intense episode days and other meteorological 
parameters such as inversions and light winds are seen in many cities. In Istanbul, 
inversions form by radiative cooling at night or as a result of subsidence in anticyclones. 
Table 6 gives the characteristics of inversions recorded from radio sounding station at 
Goztepe-Istanbul in the period of November 1989 – February 1990. There are almost 16 
episodes occurring in this period and the days with surface or elevated inversions almost 
coincide with the episode days.

Table 6. Frequency and depth of inversions in Istanbul during November 1989-February 
1990 (Incecik, 1996). 
According to Table 3, the heights of the night time surface inversions in 48% of the cases are 
below 250m. Furthermore, it is found that during the episodic period, calms are about 20% 
or more of the total episodic periods which are probably associated with weak synoptic 
scale pressure gradient at the surface atmosphere in Istanbul. 
In Istanbul, natural gas usage has just started in January 1992 in the Asian part of the city. 
Hence, the city of Istanbul, particularly in European side, has faced many significant 
episodic air quality problems due to the poor quality lignite usage and weak dispersion 
conditions in winter periods up to mid 1990s. As an example, one of the dramatic air 
pollution episodes had been experienced in 1993 winter. The catastrophic values of the SO2 
and TSP were measured to be 4070 and 2662 µg/m3, respectively, on 18th of January 1993 in 
the European part of the city (Batuk et al., 1997). The stagnant anticyclonic pressure 
conditions continued for two days in the city and Governor of Istanbul announced the 
emergency situation in the city particularly for sensible people such as older people and 
babies. The schools were closed for two days following the decision in the city. Fig. 6 gives 
the surface synoptic map for 18 January at 00Z. As it can be seen from this figure, a very 
strong anticyclonic pressure system was established over the Central Mediterranean and 
South Europe and consequently the Balkan Peninsula up to the west part of the Asia Minor 
and Black Sea Balkan Peninsula. Such synoptic conditions favor the formation of an 
anticyclonic subsidence inversion, which results in residential and industrial stack plumes 
capping specifically in the European side of the city. Fig.7 indicates the 850 hPa map 
indicating geopotential heights and temperatures. This map indicates very strong 
temperature advection over Istanbul.

of January 17, a surface temperature inversion was formed. On January 17, the first day of 
the episode, the surface pressure was rather high over the entire Balkans and Eastern 
Mediterranean. The light surface winds blew from southern directions, weak at noon and 
from SW at night (Fig.9). The thermodynamic structure of the lower atmosphere during the 
episode shows that during the night of 17 January, a strong surface inversion was formed 
with a depth of 230 m more than 5o C in strength as result of warm advection. On that night 
surface atmospheric pressure was 1028 hPa and surface winds measured at the Goztepe 
meteorological stations from 17th January 00Z to 19 January 12 Z were light (~1 m/s) 
throughout the night and daytime period. around 1 m/s were at the south and southwest

directions. The pollutants (SO2 and TSP) were accumulated during the following day due to 
the stagnant weather conditions. Very dramatic concentrations of SO2 and TSP (4070 and 
2662 μg/m3) on 18th January 1993 were measured to be associated with very strong surface 
inversion and stagnant conditions during the poor quality coal usage in the European and 
west parts of Istanbul. The episode ends on January 20, when a strong low pressure system 
moves over the Black Sea.

Fig. 9. Surface winds at 10m on 18 January 1993 at 00Z. 
The hourly concentrations of PM10 were examined by several researchers. As an example, 
Karaca et al. (2005) interpreted the analyses for monthly average variations of PM10 
concentrations in Istanbul. The numerical results of the study indicate that cyclonic behavior 
of the time series of PM10 concentrations occurs in winter and summer times with the effect 
of prevailing meteorological conditions. According to Kindap et al. (2006) Istanbul had 
hourly PM10 levels observed from monitoring sites that were in excess of 300µg/m3 at 
several locations in the beginning of 2000s. Attributing to predominantly westerly winds at 
this period it is investigated that long-range transport is effective on elevating PM levels in 
Istanbul. Following the 2000s, air quality levels for Istanbul present different characteristics 
based on the changing of emission sources in the city. Fig. 10 presents the temporal variation 
of the annual average concentrations of some critical pollutants following fuel switching 
period in the city. In this figure, the hourly PM10, SO2 and NOx, concentrations reported over 
the five year period (1 January 2005 through 31 December 2010).As seen in the figure sulfur 
dioxide concentrations in the city remained below the air quality standards whereas PM10 
and NO2 concentrations exceeded the air quality standards.

Fig. 10. Temporal variation of annual average PM10, SO2 and NO2 concentrations (µg/m3) in 
Istanbul. 
In a recent study, Unal et al., (2011) assessed the PM10 data in ten monitoring stations 
considering the EU PM10 standards, and to identify air-monitoring sites with similar 
pollutant behavior characteristics by means of hierarchical cluster analysis and to explore 
possible pollutant sources in such clusters. PM10 concentration averages over the monitoring 
sites under the influence of urban traffic and residential heating greatly exceeded the EU’s 
daily ambient air quality standard. As an example, PM10 data for the monitoring stations of 
the metropolitan air quality monitoring network show that about 32% of the total days in 6 
years (2005-2010) daily PM10 concentrations exceed the limit value of 50 µg/m3 within the 
city. Istanbul yields an urban average PM10 of 58 µg/m3. The monthly means for all stations 
vary in between 32-68 µg/m3 in summer and 43-87 µg/m3 in winter. Unal et al., (2011) 
indicated that Kartal (Asian site) Esenler and Alibeykoy (European sites) (Fig.4), where 
urban areas with high traffic and industrial activity, were seriously polluted by PM10. Many 
people who live in the Kartal region might be exposed to a much higher PM10 level than the 
rest of the population. Topography or the barriers in the city environment of the Kartal 
might support the accumulation of the concentrations. These results indicate that higher the 
PM10 concentration, the greater the risk of premature mortality from heart and lung disease 
to the residents living in these locations. Celebi et al. (2010) found similar PM10 results for 
these locations (Fig.11).

The first complete chemical composition data for PM10 levels in Istanbul has been provided 
by Theodosi et al. (2010). Daily PM10 samples were collected at the Bogazici University 
Campus and major ionic species as well as metals and organic and elemental carbon were 
measured between November 2007 and June 2009. Fig. 12 shows the temporal variation of 
major chemical species in Istanbul during the sampling period and Fig.13 shows the 
contribution of aerosol species to PM10 concentrations. The seasonal variations of metallic 
elements revealed that elements of mainly natural origin peak during spring, associated 
with natural processes such as wind flow (Sahara dust transport), whereas elements 
associated with human activities peak during winter, due to domestic heating, traffic-related 
and industrial emissions. The organic to elemental carbon ratio indicates that the organic 
carbon is mostly primary and that the elemental part is strongly linked to traffic. During 
winter additional sources like household heating contribute to the total carbon loadings. The 
water-soluble organic to organic carbon ratio is characteristic for an urban area, 
demonstrating a higher ratio in the summertime, mostly due to the large fraction of 
secondary (oxidized and more soluble) organic species.

Im et al. (2010) simulated the high PM10 levels observed during 13 to 17th of January, 2008 
and showed that high resolution modeling with updated anthropogenic emissions can 
successfully reproduce the wintertime episodes associated with local anthropogenic 
emissions. Figure 14 shows the OC/PM10 ratios simulated by Im et al. (2010) which clearly 
indicate the nature of PM levels in the urban parts of the city. Around the emissions hot 
spots, which are located along the two sides of the Bosphorus, the ratios are calculated to be 
highest (~0.40). Figure 15 shows the origin of crustal materials from Sahara based on Kocak 
et al. (2011). As seen in the figure, Algerian, Libyan and Tunisian deserts are the important 
sources of natural dust affecting Istanbul, as well the north-eastern parts of Black sea region. 
The analysis has been conducted based on the extensive PM10 chemical composition data 
from November 2007 to June 2009 in Istanbul (Theodosi et al., 2010). Further analysis 
conducted by Kocak et al. (2011) clearly showed the potential impacts of Istanbul on its 
surroundings (Fig.16). The results show that Istanbul is under influence of several sources 
including Balkans and Eastern European countries. On the other hand, Istanbul pollution 
influences western Black Sea, Balkan counties, Levantine Basin and north-eastern Africa 
countries.

6.6.1 Surface ozone variations in Istanbul 
Surface ozone is a secondary pollutant produced by a series of complicated photochemical 
reactions involving NOx and HCs in the present of intense solar radiation. The first 
measurements of surface ozone at two sites in Istanbul (Kadikoy and Aksaray as seen in 
Fig.1)) were studied by Topcu & Incecik (2002 and 2003). They showed that ozone levels do 
not show yet episodic values in the city. But, when meteorological conditions are favorable 
such as when Istanbul and its surrounding region were dominated by an anticyclonic 
pressure system, ozone levels becomes high. During conducive ozone days, southerly and 
south-westerly winds with low speeds (<1m/s) influence Istanbul. Fig 17 presents the time 
serious of the daily peak ozone concentrations in between 2001-2006. Im et al., (2008)

evaluated the highest ozone concentrations in Istanbul. They observed in summer periods 
having sunny days and maximum temperatures above 25 °C, and the episodes were mainly 
characterized by south-westerly surface winds during the day and north-easterly surface 
winds during the night. A modeling study conducted by Im et al. (2011a) showed that a 
NOx-sensitive ozone chemistry is more pronounced in the northern parts of the city that are 
characterized by forested areas with high biogenic VOC emissions. Furthermore, the high 
anthropogenic NOx emissions in the urban parts leads to response of ozone more to changes 
in NOx, agreeing with the findings of Im et al. (2008).

Furthermore, an assessment of the wind field simulations for a case study in explaining the 
ozone formation mechanism over Istanbul is performed by Anteplioglu et al., 2003. In this 
study, meteorological conditions favorable for high ozone concentrations appear when 
Istanbul and the surrounding region are dominated by an anticyclonic pressure system. 
During the ozone favorable days, south and south-westerly winds with low wind speed 
influence Istanbul. In addition to the examining of the available monitoring air quality data 
in the city, surface ozone concentrations and NO, NO2 were measured first time at three 
different sites one is on the island (Prince’s Island or Büyükada) as background site; semi 
urban site, Kandilli just over the Bosphorus and as a nearby major high way site (Goztepe 
DMO). Figures 18a,b and 19a,b present the time serious of the data for the major high way 
and background stations (Incecik et al., 2010). The assessment of meteorological variables 
has shown that the production and destruction of the surface ozone was highly related to 
temperature and wind speeds. In urban and rural areas emissions of NO decrease ozone 
concentrations in the absence of solar radiation due to the reaction O3, NO, NO2 and NOx. 
Conversely, O3 concentrations show comparatively less diurnal variability in rural areas due 
to the absence of high NOx emission sources.

Im et al. (2011b) simulated the summertime ozone concentrations in the Eastern 
Mediterranean, evaluating the contribution of the physical and chemical process to the 
simulated ozone levels. The results showed that for Istanbul, due to the high NOx emissions, 
chemistry is a sink by 34% in the surface layer and 45% in the whole PBL. By horizontal 
(28%) and vertical transport (22%), Istanbul receives ozone. For the precursors of ozone 
(NOx and VOCs), Istanbul is a sink in terms of transport, leading to transport of these 
species to downwind locations to produce ozone. Fig.20 shows the simulated surface ozone 
and NOx concentrations in the area. As seen in the Fig. 20a, Istanbul is characterized by low 
ozone concentrations (~19 ppb) due to the high NOx (Fig.20b)).

6.7 Concluded remarks for Istanbul 
As a summary, Istanbul had experienced many episodic air pollution events. One is very 
dramatic happened in January 1993. It is similar to a small scale London smog event. 
Following these events, Istanbul Greater Municipality established several strategically 
programs in Istanbul for air quality management in the beginning of 1990s. The first action 
was about the strict control program for the use of poor quality lignite in domestic heating 
and industry. Then fuel switching program was established in the city in 1992. It was first 
started in Asian parts of the city and then gradually expanded to the citywide. Now, about 
95% of the city has natural gas. On the other hand, coal combustion is still a leading factor of 
the particulate emissions at residential heating even if it has a limited consumption in the 
city. Due to the high natural gas prices in the country, in recent years, some parts of the 
urban areas use coal instead of natural gas even if they are equipped with natural gas 
system in their houses. Furthermore, periodical motor vehicle inspection stations 
established at international standards in late 2008. However, traffic is still the most polluting 
sector for NOx, NMVOC and CO emissions. Surface ozone levels are not elevated but 
depending on the increasing number of the motor vehicles, ozone potential is developing in 
the city.  Industry is the most polluting sector for both sides of the city. Finally, shipping 
emissions over the Bosphorus in Istanbul is becoming serious problem. The emissions 
should be strictly controlled. 
7. Conclusions 
Megacities in general experience elevated levels of primary pollutants such as particular 
matter, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide whereas they influence the secondary 
pollutants like ozone in their surrounding regions. Air pollution in megacities has been 
influenced by many factors such as topography, meteorology, emissions from domestic 
heating, industry and traffic. The level of air pollution in megacities depends on the

country’s technology and pollution control capability by air quality improving plans, using 
cleaner fuels, renewable.  
Megacities in developed and developing countries have different emission sources and air 
quality problems. Most of the megacities in developed countries (Los Angeles, New York, 
USA; Osaka, Tokyo, Japan and Paris, France) motor vehicles have been the major emission 
source and PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 were the critical air quality parameters whereas, industry, 
motor vehicles and residential heating were major emissions in developing countries. In 
addition to the emission sources, the critical air quality parameters in megacities of 
developing countries are PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO. Dust transport leads to serious air 
quality and visibility problem in some megacities in developing countries such as Beijing 
and Cairo.  
Rapid urbanization has resulted in increasing urban air pollution in major cities, especially 
in the developing countries. Over 90% of air pollution in cities of these countries is 
attributed to vehicle emissions brought about by high number of older vehicles coupled 
with low fuel quality. Increased population density causes new risks for the residents 
through deteriorated environment and social problems due to the intense and complicated 
interactions between economic, demographic, social political and ecological processes in 
megacities.  
Finally, in megacities of the developing world, in order to enhance quality of life, city 
planning needs to adopt new visions and innovating management tools. One of the key 
public concerns in megacities is transportation. High population density and high motor 
vehicle rates need to be improved. Transport policies should consist of multiple strategies 
particularly in developing countries.

Air pollution has always been a trans-boundary environmental problem and a matter of global concern for past
many years. High concentrations of air pollutants due to numerous anthropogenic activities influence the air
quality. There are many books on this subject, but the one in front of you will probably help in filling the gaps
existing in the area of air quality monitoring, modelling, exposure, health and control, and can be of great help
to graduate students professionals and researchers. The book is divided in two volumes dealing with various
monitoring techniques of air pollutants, their predictions and control. It also contains case studies describing
the exposure and health implications of air pollutants on living biota in different countries across the globe.
